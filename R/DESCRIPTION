Description: This package is an API for transferase. Transferase enables
  access to massive volumes of remotely stored sequencing-based whole genome
  DNA methylation profiles, with the aim delivering results at speeds expected
  from locally stored data. Transferase include a collection of data formats
  and algorithms for fast computation of methylation levels through arbitrary
  genomic intervals, supporting flexible queries for the most useful summary
  statistics. The client apps and APIs of transferase are designed to
  facilitate exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing. The public
  transferase server interfaces with MethBase2, a database that includes over
  13,000 high-quality WGBS methylomes from mammalian species (04/2025). Since
  version 0.6.0, transferase clients include command line apps for Linux and
  macOS, along with a Python package and an R package.
