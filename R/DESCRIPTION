Description: This package provides functions that use the transferase system
  to retrieve methylome data from MethBase2. The transferase system include a
  collection of file formats and algorithms for querying methylation levels
  for specified genomic intervals very efficiently, along with a communication
  protocol for efficiently responding to queries remotely. This enables users
  to conduct exploratory data analysis as though terabytes of methylome data
  were already on their local systems.
